            The Aquarium has a smart, autonomous environment management system. This control panel allows platform
            managers to access this environment, monitor sensors data and status, manually trigger actuators and configure
            thresholds of autonomous activation for each actuator. Indeed, each actuator is able to communicate directly with
            its related sensor to know when an activation is necessary, without direct human intervention.
            This web page offers:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A <a href="./home">Home</a> page, where the user can see some overall information about sensors and tanks
                    in the network. A very useful feature of this page is that it shows a
                    <a href="./home#warnings">warnings</a> table, where tanks with defective devices are highlighted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A <a href="./tanklist">Tanks</a> page, where the user can see an exhaustive list of all the tanks
                    in The Aquarium. The user can then click on a tank and switch to that tank menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A specific management page for each tank, accessible through the tanks menu. This page is the core
                    of this web site: it shows all devices installed in the chosen tank. For each sensor device, it lets
                    users know the last sample value and plot all samples in the last two hours in a graph.
                    For each actuator device, it lets users trigger its activation/deactivation and choose new thresholds
                    for its autonomous activation.
